## First Block of my lego Death star
Okay so we gotta start from somewhere, by the why I have a partner, lets call him Nagu for now ( I dont know if he wants me to put his name here). It might be an oversimplification but to reach space we need a lot of money, which sadly we do not have. So the first block is a way to Build capital. Hence this post is my first step towards the first block, I know its nothing but.. its a start. TBH I mainly am writing this so I have a space to share these thoughts with Nagu, cause my phone cannot handle to open Notion anymore *\*sigh\**.

Okay now that I have set up the premise its time for some research notes, the first block can be achieved through many routes we thought, as I am writing this Nagu is also atempting to soft launch an influencer platform... kinda, its called Slurp. Also, If you havent come across it yet, I kinda suck at spelling, just ignore it, Ill be sure to atleast keep the context clear ( hopefully ). So coming back to the research I am doing.... 

### Drones are kinda cool 
The idea is to enter into a sector that is both lucrative and will provide expirience to further into heavy engineering and navigational tech. The defense sector is one such field that gives the possibility to develop both of the above-mentioned aspects. However we need to pick the right angle of entry, can t just go around experimenting as we neither have the capital nor the resources to do so. Defense drones are of particular interest lately as for a country such as India which does not have any such Indigenous product, we can tap into this need. 

First of we need to look at what the current players are doing in the Unmanned Aerial Systems sector. Lets start with, 

#### Tata Advance systems 
These guys have two major models that are out:
1. Sky-1 ( https://www.tataadvancedsystems.com/sky-I ): A fixed wing fully autonomous platform with long range and endurance capability. This platform can be hand launched for take-off and is equipped with a belly landing system.
2. RAKSHAK VTOL ( https://www.tataadvancedsystems.com/vtol ): A fully autonomous Vertical Take off and Landing (VTOL) UAV, takes off like a Quadcopter, transitions into fixed wing mode for long distance travel, lands back at a point like a Quadcopter. Ideal for operations from restricted areas such as jungles, hill tops, ships etc.

Both of these are of a recon nature and don't provide fighting capabilities. 

Other potential players include: 
1. Mahindra Aerospace
2. Kalyani Group â€“ Bharat Forge
3. Adani Aero Defense Systems & Technologies Ltd

Now that we have looked at the existing players, lets look..
