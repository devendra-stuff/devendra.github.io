## First Block of my lego Death start
Okay so we gotta start from somewhere, by the why I have a partner, lets call him Nagu for now ( I dont know if he wants me to put his name here). It might be an oversimplification but to reach space we need a lot of money, which sadly we do not have. So the first block is a way to Build capital. Hence this post is my first step towards the first block, I know its nothing but.. its a start. TBH I mainly am writing this so I have a space to share these thoughts with Nagu, cause phone cannot handle to open Notion anymore *sigh*.

Okay now that I have set up the premise its time for some research notes, the first block can be achieved through many routes we thought, as I am writing this Nagu is also atempting to soft launch an influencer platform... kinda, its called Slurp. Also, If you havent come across it yet, I kinda suck at spelling, just ignore it, Ill be sure to atleast keep the context clear ( hopefully ). So coming back to the research I am doing....
